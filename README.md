# Hyprland configuration

This is the base configuration of my hyprland, to use it one will need to install a few packages:
1. hyprland
2. waybar (for the bar/taskbar)
3. pywal (for color matching with the wallpaper)
4. rofi (app launcher)
5. swaylock (for locking the computer)
6. wlogout ( for a logout menu)
7. kitty
It is important to note that other than hyprland 
all of them are optional but essential for this setup to work, 
once you have it installed and understand how it is working, feel free to change it to your liking.
 ## Where to put the files

 except the .scripts folder, place everything else in .config folder(overwrite your folders if you have to)
 place the .scripts folder in your home directory.
 you should be good, now you can just edit the configs, mainly the hyprland as my monitor might not match yours
 and you might want to change ohter things, just read through it most is self explanatory.
